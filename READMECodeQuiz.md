# Coding is like Jenga Quiz
Description: I made this coding is like jenga quiz to give the user a more lively and comical experience that will intrigue them to see if the questions are a little different than their usual question and answers or if some are similar to what they normally take. The target user is mainly for coding students or junior programmers to review their knowledge.
